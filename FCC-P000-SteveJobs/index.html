                <li>We're gambling on our vision, and we would rather do that than make "me too" products. Let some other
                  companies do that. For us, it's always the next dream.</li>
                <li>If, for some reason, we make some big mistake and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going
                  to enter a computer Dark Ages for about twenty years.</li>
                <li>Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the
                  world?</li>
                <li>It's more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy.</li>
                <li>You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it
                  built, they'll want something new.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>What a computer is to me is it's the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It's the equivalent
                  of a bicycle for our minds.</li>
                <li>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we've done
                  something wonderful... that's what matters to me.</li>
                <li>I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful
                  ones is pure perseverance. It is so hard.</li>
                <li>Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you're not going to survive. You're going to give it up.
                  So you've got to have an idea, or a problem or a wrong that you want to right that you're passionate about
                  otherwise you're not going to have the perseverance to stick it through. I think that's half the battle
                  right there.</li>
                <li>When you're young, you look at television and think, There's a conspiracy. The networks have conspired
                  to dumb us down. </li>
                <li>Nobody has tried to swallow us since I've been here. I think they are afraid how we would taste.</li>

                <li>We used to dream about this stuff. Now we get to build it. It's pretty great.</li>
                <li>We think basically you watch television to turn your brain off, and you work on your computer when you
                  want to turn your brain on.</li>
                <li>The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined
                  company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about.</li>
                <li>We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate

                <li>Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you
                  have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your
                  gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give
                  you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make
                  all the difference.</li>
                <li>I didn't see it then, but it turned out that <strong>getting fired from Apple was the best thing that
                    could have ever happened to me.</strong> </li>
                <li>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing
                  that kept me going was that I loved what I did. <strong>You’ve got to find what you love</strong>. And
                  that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your
                  life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way
                  to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with
                  all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets
                  better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle.</li>
                <li> <strong>I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my
                    life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too
                    many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</strong></li>
                <li>Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the
                  big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment
                  or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering
                  that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
                  You are already naked. <strong>There is no reason not to follow your heart.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.</strong> Don't be trapped
                  by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others'
                  opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and
                  intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</li>
